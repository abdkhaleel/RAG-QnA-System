# 1. Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
# We use a 'slim' version for a smaller image size
FROM python:3.11-slim

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container
# All subsequent commands will run from this path
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy the file that lists our dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .

# 4. Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file
# --no-cache-dir makes the image smaller
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 5. Copy the rest of our application's code into the container
COPY . .

# 6. Expose the port that our FastAPI app runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# 7. Define the command to run when the container starts
# This is the same command uvicorn uses to start our server
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
